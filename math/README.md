- Can all number theoretic problems be reduced to some canonical notation such that the act of posing the problem is solving it?
- Can all exotic mathematical objects be uniquely mapped to natural numbers?
- What is the relationship between information bandwidth and geometric notions of curvature?
- How to map the real line to the interval \[0,1\]?
- Can a real function of two variables be bijectively mapped to a real function of one variable?
- What is the connection between information and integer sequences?
- Can all integer sequence problems be reduced to a formal language/grammar problem?
- What is the minimum requirement for there to exist a isomorphim between two structures?
- What is the minimum requirement for there to exist a canonical isomorphim from any structure to the natural numbers or vice versa?
- Create an alternative to the polar coordinate system that uses dot product instead
  - Assuming you set Pi/4 (or y = f[x] = x) as the reference direction
    - along y =x, would be = 1
    - the two directions perpendicular to y = x would be zero and,
    - -1 would be antiparallel to 1
- Create a coordinate system where the identity is not y = x, but some other user defined function
